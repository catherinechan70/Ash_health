####################Calculates the Vegitation indices for the spectral library developed from headwall's bandpases####
# Ash Vegetation Indices

library(spectrolab)
library(tidyverse)
library(hsdar)

##Reads in image as dataframe (created in the resampling script)
all_ash_samps <- read.csv("ROutputs//all_ash_Df") 


##Now lets check the range of the values in the image
#test<-lapply(all_ash_samps[,-1:-2],range)%>%as.data.frame%>%t()%>%as.data.frame
#test%>%View()
#test%>%lapply(range) ### All values fall between 0 and 1.2 and there are no NA values



##Reads in bandpasses for imagery to be used later
HDW_wv<-scan("OriginalData//Headwall_wv", numeric())

#EightMileTest_HDW[is.na(EightMileTest_HDW$`397.593`),]%>% nrow()

###you'll need to convert your dfs to a matrix before VIS can be applied
##lets fo this for df created from the image and our spectral library of scans
all_ash_samps_matrix   <-as.matrix(all_ash_samps   [-1:-4])

##Now that we have our matrix we can create our spectralib object that will be used to create a df with all the veg indices ???!!!
all_ash_samps_speclib   <-speclib  (all_ash_samps_matrix[-1:-4]   ,HDW_wv[1:272])

##creates a vectror of names of all the vegitation indices...there are 115 of these
VIs<-vegindex()

##Vegitation indices mREIP won't work so remove it from list
##Remember the field spectral library was resampled on the headwall sensor's bandpasses...400nm-100nm
##This means some Veg indices won't generate values because those bands are not present
##Lets remove thos VIs that won't work
VIs<-VIs[-c(3,26,27,31,32,33,35,48,49,58,60,66,67,71,82,99,102,103,104,105)]

##Creates dataframe with Vegitation indices ???????????????
all_ash_samps_VIs       <-vegindex(all_ash_samps_speclib        ,index=VIs)

##rename columns
colnames(all_ash_samps_VIs  )<-VIs

##lets do a logical test on EightMileTest_HDW_VIs to see if strange values exist
##Here we need an ifelse function to remove NaNs and Inf or possibly convert them to NAs/0s
#test3<-lapply(all_ash_samps,range)%>%as.data.frame%>%t()%>%as.data.frame
##test3%>%View()##There are no columns where NaNs and Inf exist in this dataframe

##we need to combine lat/long columns with our new VI variables
all_ash_samps_A  <-cbind(all_ash_samps   [1:2],all_ash_samps   )

##Now we have to ensure that all column names have no spaces nor arithmetic operators
